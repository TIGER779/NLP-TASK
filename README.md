Loading the IMDb Dataset: Importing preprocessed movie reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels.

Data Preprocessing: Padding sequences to ensure uniform input length for the RNN model.

Building the RNN Model: Constructing a Sequential model with an Embedding layer followed by an RNN (SimpleRNN or LSTM) and a Dense output layer.

Training the Model: Compiling the model with appropriate loss and optimizer functions, then training it on the training data.
